# Sargasso

Sargasso is my attempt at creating a web client for the board game [Shipwreck Arcana, by Meromorph Games](https://www.meromorphgames.com/shipwreck-arcana). This is primarily a project which I will use for learning and practicing my coding as I am still not very proficient. However, ideally, this will become a fully functional webapp akin to [hanabi.cards](https://hanabi.cards/), [horsepaste (Codenames)](https://www.horsepaste.com/), and other similar webapp versions of boardgames. 

## Requirements

Sargasso is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/), and whatever other library I haphazardly tack on because it has useful functionality with no regard to bloat. 

## Disclaimer

I have no affiliation whatsoever with Shipwreck Arcana or Meromorph games, who are the legal owners of this property. I simply enjoy the game. If you enjoy the game as well, please buy a [physical copy](https://www.meromorphgames.com/shop/shipwreck-arcana) to support the original publishers. I will gladly take down this github repository if asked to by Meromorph Games!
